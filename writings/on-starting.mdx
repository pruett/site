Why is it often so difficult to start? In my experience it’s a result of one or more of the following factors: fear, perseverance, and motivation. Each of these can be examined and broken down further, but I’m most interested in examining the component of fear.

Fear is a tremendous inhibitor to any creative pursuit. It could manifest internally, externally, or some combination of both. You might fear that your work will be perceived negatively by your peers. Alternatively, you may be focusing your insecurities inwards and fear your art won’t live up to your own expectations.

I suppose the fear I’m describing above is more accurately a symptom of finishing, rather than starting. Perhaps any creative endeavor holds with it the unsettling reality that eventually one’s work will be in front of others to judge. Starting may simply be the point at which this scenario begins to become a possibility. Maybe starting isn’t necessarily the hard bit, but instead, it is finishing which is truly difficult.
