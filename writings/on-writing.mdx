I’ve decided to try my hand at writing with some frequency. As opposed to jotting down thoughts in a notebook, taking the time to type words and structure sentences gives it a sense of “permanence”. For me, this is sort of scary. This is one of many reasons why I don’t write.

## Why scary?

Revisiting past work is often embarrassing. Especially the early work. I’m the type of person who hates portfolios for this very reason. I’m far more apt to delete than to create. I want to change that.

## Why is past work embarrassing to revisit?

I think it has something to do with philosophies, abilities, and tastes naturally adapting over time. Some people probably enjoy viewing the progression of their art. For whatever reason, it’s very difficult for me.

## So why write at all?

The benefits are purely therapeutic. There is no intended audience but myself at the moment of writing. I want to conquer “The Resistance”, “The Lizard Brain”, the amygdala; the primal brain stimuli that prevents one from producing, creating, and most importantly, releasing. I need to practice overcoming that. This is my humble attempt at doing so.

(This self-interviewing style of writing is a bit schizophrenic but helps me more effectively answer questions and topics I often ponder. I’ll likely continue writing in this style until I develop better ways of communicating my thoughts and ideas.)
